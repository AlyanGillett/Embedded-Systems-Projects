# Embedded-Systems-Projects

In this comprehensive embedded systems project, I meticulously designed, rigorously tested, and proficiently implemented a range of functionalities. This encompassed precise LED light displays, seamless integration of LCD screens for song lyric rendering, intricate motor control mechanisms, and real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity data. Furthermore, I successfully engineered an advanced climate control system utilizing a DHT11 sensor and motor fan, which demonstrated my proficiency in both hardware and software aspects. This project not only showcased my technical skills but also highlighted my commitment to furthering my expertise during the summer break.
