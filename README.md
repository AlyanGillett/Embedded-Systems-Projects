# Embedded-Systems-Projects

In these comprehensive embedded systems projects, I meticulously designed, rigorously tested, and proficiently implemented a range of functionalities. This encompassed precise LED light displays, seamless integration of LCD screens for song lyric rendering, intricate motor control mechanisms, and real-time temperature and humidity data monitoring. Furthermore, I successfully engineered an advanced climate control system utilizing a DHT11 sensor and motor fan.
